Across industrialized countries, it is a well-studied phenomenon 
that childless women are paid more on average than mothers. In 
this exercise, we use survey data to investigate and measure
the wage gap between women with children and childless women.

The exercise is based on: Wei-hsin Yu and J
anet Chen-Lan Kuo. 2017. [The Motherhood Wage Penalty by Work 
Conditions: How Do Occupational Characteristics Hinder or 
Empower Mothers?](https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122417712729)" 
*American Sociological Review* 82(4): 744-769.

In this paper, the authors examine the association between 
the so-called *mother wage penalty* (i.e., the pay gap between mothers 
and non-mothers) and occupational characteristics. Three prominent 
explanations for the motherhood wage penalty--"stressing work-family conflict 
and job performance," "compensating differentials," and "employer 
discrimination"--provide hypotheses about the relationship 
between penalty changes and occupational characteristics.
The authors use data from 16 waves of the National Longitudinal 
Survey of Youth to estimate the effects of five occupational 
characteristics on the mother wage penalty and to test these 
hypotheses. 

This paper uses a type of data known as 'panel data.' Panel data consist of 
observations on the same people over time. In this example, we are going to 
analyze the same women over multiple years. When analyzing panel data, each 
time period is referred to as a *wave*, so here each year is a wave.

The data file is `yu2017sample.csv`, which is a CSV file. The names 
and descriptions of variables are:

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Name                 Description
 -------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
 `PUBID`              ID of woman

 `year`               Year of observation
 
 `wage`               Hourly wage, in cents

 `numChildren`        Number of children that the woman has (in this wave)
 
 `age`                Age in years
 
 `region`             Name of region (North East = 1, North Central = 2, South = 3, West = 4)
 
 `urban`              Geographical classification (urban = 1, otherwise = 0)
      
 `marstat`            Marital status
 
 `educ`               Level of education
 
 `school`             School enrollment (enrolled = `TRUE`, otherwise = `FALSE`)
 
 `experience`         Experience since 14 years old, in days
 
 `tenure`             Current job tenure, in years
 
 `tenure2`            Current job tenure in years, squared
 
 `fullTime`           Employment status (employed full-time = `TRUE`, otherwise = `FALSE`)
 
 `firmSize`           Size of the firm
 
 `multipleLocations`  Multiple locations indicator (firm with multiple locations = 1, otherwise = 0)
 
 `unionized`          Job unionization status (job is unionized = 1, otherwise = 1)
 
 `industry`           Job's industry type
 
 `hazardous`          Hazard measure for the job (between 1 and 2)
 
 `regularity`         Regularity measure for the job (between 1 and 5)

## Question 1

How many different women are in the data? How many observations 
  per year? We will refer to each row as a 'person-year observation' 
  since the row contains data on a given person in a particular year.
  In a few sentences, describe one advantage and one disadvantage of using 
  a contemporary cohort of women rather than an older cohort in 
  estimating the predictors of the mother wage gap.

## Question 2

`numChildren` is the variable representing how many children 
  the woman had at the time of an observation. Please provide a table 
  that shows the proportion of observations by the number of children.
  Provide a brief substantive interpretation of the results.

## Question 3

Create a new indicator variable `isMother` that takes a value of 1 
  if the woman has at least one child in that year and a value 
  of 0 otherwise. Tabulate the new variable. Briefly comment on 
  the results.

## Question 4

Create a new variable called `logwage` that is the log of `wage`. 
  Make two boxplots, one for `wage` and the other for `logwage`, 
  as a function of educational level (`educ`). Compare the two boxplots 
  and discuss the purpose of the log transformation. 

## Question 5

In the same graph, plot the mean `logwage` against year for mothers, 
  then for non-mothers in a different color or line type. Include 
  a legend and a proper title. Make sure the figure and axes are 
  clearly labeled. Give a brief interpretation of the results.
 
## Question 6

Create a quantile-quantile plot comparing the distribution of log wages
  of mothers and non-mothers. Comment briefly on the resulting plot.
